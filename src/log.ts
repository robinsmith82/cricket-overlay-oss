/**
 * Append one row to the scrape_log D1 table for every real scrape attempt.
 *
 * Sets `changed=1` when (runs, wickets, overs, status) differ from the
 * previous row for the same match_id. Cache hits don't reach this function —
 * only actual `scrapeMatch()` results are logged. Logging failures are
 * swallowed: never let an audit-trail bug break a scrape.
 *
 * Concurrency: change-detection runs inside the INSERT itself (correlated
 * subquery against MAX(id) for this match) so two near-simultaneous scrapes
 * can't both compare against the same stale "previous" row. SQLite serializes
 * writes within the D1 instance, so the comparison sees whichever insert won
 * the storage-tier ordering. The id column is AUTOINCREMENT — no PK clashes.
